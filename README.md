A trivial implementation of the classic mathematical *Josephus Problem* with an aesthetic *GUI*.

## Description
The Josephus Problem is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. This implementation visualizes the problem in an interactive graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to explore the problem's mechanics dynamically.

## Features
- Intuitive GUI for visualizing the Josephus problem.
- Ability to customize the number of soldiers and the counting step.
- A random starting point each Round.
- Visual representation of the elimination process.

## Compilation
You will require a compiler supporting C++11. Follow these steps to compile the project:
