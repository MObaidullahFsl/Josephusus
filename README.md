# Josephus
A trivial implementation of the classic mathematical *Josephus Problem* with an aesthetic *GUI*.

## Description
The Josephus Problem is a theoretical problem related to a certain counting-out game. This implementation visualizes the problem in an interactive graphical user interface (GUI), allowing users to explore the problem's mechanics dynamically.
